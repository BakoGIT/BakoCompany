// =================================================================
// ASSETS/MAIN.JS - DEPRECATED
// =================================================================
// 
// This file previously contained duplicate functionality that has been
// consolidated into main.js for better code organization and performance.
// 
// Moved functionality:
// - Mobile menu toggle (now in main.js)
// - Smooth scrolling for anchor links (now in main.js) 
// - Product card animation observer (now in main.js)
// 
// This file is kept for compatibility but is no longer required.
// All functionality has been consolidated into the main.js file.

// If you need to add new asset-specific functionality, add it below this comment.
